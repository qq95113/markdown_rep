# **Analysis and Stock Picking Based on Fundamentals**

## Common characteristics of stocks that have increased more than ten times in the past five years.

Stocks that have increased more than 10 times in value over the past five years often exhibit specific characteristics identifiable through several fundamental features:

- **Industry Trends:**
A notable concentration of these high-performing stocks is observed in fast-growing sectors, particularly the Information Technology industry, which makes up 20.0% of these stocks.  This sector is typically characterized by rapid innovation and adoption of new technologies, affording companies within it opportunities for significant market expansion and value appreciation.  This trend suggests that aligning with promising industries that are at the cutting edge of innovation is a common characteristic of stocks capable of achieving tenfold growth.

- **Valuation Rationality:**
These stocks often demonstrate unique valuation metrics, especially in terms of EV/EBIT ratios, with values ranging from -7.958 to -2.844.  Despite this range positioning them at the lower end of the market spectrum, it indicates a potential undervaluation or significant growth potential.  The negative EV/EBIT is unusual, often reflecting expectations of transformative growth that surpasses temporary operational inefficiencies or reorganization processes, setting these firms apart as undervalued relative to earnings expectations.

- **Profitability:**
Despite being high-performers, these companies often display less promising profitability metrics, such as net profit margins between -0.38 and -0.087 and ROA values from -0.019 to 0.002.  These figures indicate they are positioned at the lower to lower-middle levels in the market.  Such low margins and returns on assets could point to aggressive reinvestment strategies where companies prioritize growth over immediate profitability, or recent changes in their operations that, while currently underperforming, are expected to enhance future profitability.  Additionally, their tax-asset figures, ranging from -1.16 to 0.018, position them at the lower-middle level, possibly reflecting significant strategic investments impacting short-term tax efficiencies but set to yield longer-term growth dividends.

**Summary and Conclusion:**

The key traits among these tenfold-up stocks are closely tied to their sectors, valuation approaches, and strategic profitability outlooks.  These businesses position themselves within innovative and transformative industries, notably Information Technology.  They might initially appear undervalued based on typical valuation metrics but signal high growth potential through their strategic, reinvestment-focused approaches.  Even with current low profitability, these companies often prioritize capital allocation towards expansion and innovation, trusting in future returns.  Recognizing these patterns allows investors to better assess which stocks might offer such explosive growth in the future.

## Common characteristics of stocks that have increased more than three times in the past four years.

Stocks that have increased more than three times over the past four years typically exhibit several common characteristics across various fundamental dimensions. Here is an analysis of these traits:

- **Industry Trends:**
High-performing stocks are often found in sectors experiencing robust growth or significant transformations.  Notably, 22.9% of these stocks are in the Energy sector, and 18.8% belong to the Consumer Discretionary sector.  These industries benefit from evolving market dynamics, such as shifts in consumer demand and advancements in technology, which can drive substantial growth opportunities.

- **Liquidity and Solvency:**
Companies with strong financial health tend to attract investor confidence.  High-performing stocks often show a Debt-to-Equity (D/E) ratio between 0.313 and 0.5, placing them in the higher segment relative to peers, suggesting a balanced approach to leveraging.  Furthermore, their Current Ratios generally range from 2.079 to 4.034, which is at the higher-middle level, indicating a robust ability to meet short-term obligations.  The Cash-MV positions of these companies, ranging from -0.159 to 0.473, also suggest they maintain a healthy operating cash flow relative to market valuation, enhancing liquidity.

- **Profitability:**
Effective profit management is a hallmark of successful stocks.  These companies often exhibit a Gross Profit Margin ranging from 0.401 to 0.629, placing them at a higher-middle level, which signifies strong operational efficiency and competitive pricing power.  A noteworthy characteristic is their Revenue-MV, which falls between 0.662 and 1.319, marking them at a higher level, indicating robust revenue generation capabilities relative to market value.

- **Valuation Rationality:**
These stocks tend to have valuation metrics that suggest a good balance between risk and growth.  For instance, their Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratios between 1.644 and 3.477 show they are assessed at a higher-middle level compared to peers, implying positive market expectations regarding their future revenue generation.  Moreover, their Price-to-Book (P/B) ratios range from 1.007 to 1.775, indicating they are valued reasonably relative to their book values, which might point to untapped asset potential.  While the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios spanning -5.45 to 9.503 might seem varied, they reflect either underappreciation by the market or anticipated earnings growth, ranking these companies at a lower-middle level.

**Summary and Conclusion:**

Stocks that have tripled in value over the past four years often emerge from dynamically growing or transforming industries, demonstrate sound financial health through high liquidity and balanced solvency metrics, maintain strong profitability metrics with consistent revenue growth, and reflect rational valuation metrics that align with growth potential.  By examining these characteristics, investors can make informed decisions when seeking out stocks with the potential for high returns.
